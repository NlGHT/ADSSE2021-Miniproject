# Longest Common Subsequence

LCSTestALL.cpp is to show the process of everything in detail of both and give examples and comparisons between the two methods.

Additionally however, the methods have their own separate files for their implementations.  These were the files used to test the different use-cases for different sizes and find the average running time and memory usage.  These are LCSRecursive.cpp for the recursive implementation and LCSMemoisation.cpp for the memoisation dynamic programming approach.

In addition I have provided the test data collected along with the code used to generate the graphs seen in the report.
